Welcome to the Web App Management App! As a front-end developer, your mission is to implement robust user authentication and access control in a React application. The app utilizes JSON data for user credentials and an Access Control List (ACL) to manage user permissions, offering a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

Created a user-friendly login form that captures username and password inputs.

Validated user input against a dataset containing user credentials (username, password, active module).
Only users with valid credentials are granted access.
Error messages (Credential is Wrong) displayed when authentication fails.
Three user roles defined with distinct access permissions.
Admin-permitted for all features in the app.
